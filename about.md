Hello! My name is Sonal. I am a rising RU senior studying computer science (B.S) with strong interests in the fields of mobile/web dev, bioinformatics, medicine, and finance. 
Currently, I am involved in research at the [Sensory and Motor Integration Lab](https://sensorymotorintegrationlab.com) at RU and I love to learn. 

If I am not reading I am either practicing yoga, lifting, or playing piano. 
I enjoy photography and writing, so feel free to review my featured photography and/or come back soon to check out my thoughts in my upcoming blog on this website!

Please contact me through email for any inquiries on my experience or prices for photoshoots and/or mobile/website development.
